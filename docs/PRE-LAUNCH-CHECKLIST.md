### 1. Social Media Links (CRITICAL)
**Location:** `src/components/Footer.tsx` (lines 43-54)

Replace placeholder social media URLs with your actual business profiles:

```tsx
// CURRENT (Placeholders):
<a href="https://facebook.com" ...>
<a href="https://instagram.com" ...>
<a href="https://twitter.com" ...>
<a href="https://linkedin.com" ...>

// REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL URLS:
<a href="https://facebook.com/yourpage" ...>
<a href="https://instagram.com/yourprofile" ...>
<a href="https://twitter.com/yourhandle" ...>
<a href="https://linkedin.com/company/yourcompany" ...>
```

If you don't have social media profiles yet, you can:
- Remove the icons temporarily

- Link to your contact page instead
