# Bundle Analysis Report

## Performance Optimizations Applied

### Code Splitting Implementation
- **Route-level lazy loading**: All non-critical routes (Blog, Admin, Tools, etc.) are now lazy loaded
- **Loading fallbacks**: Implemented spinner components for better UX during chunk loading
- **Critical path optimization**: Homepage and NotFound remain eager-loaded for instant access

### Build Optimizations
- **Manual chunking strategy**: Separated vendor libraries into logical chunks:
  - `vendor`: React core (react, react-dom)
  - `router`: React Router DOM
  - `ui`: Radix UI components
  - `supabase`: Supabase client
  - `query`: TanStack Query
  - `forms`: Form handling libraries
  - `charts`: Recharts visualization
  - `dates`: Date handling utilities
  - `utils`: Utility libraries

### Bundle Benefits
1. **Improved cache efficiency**: Vendor chunks change less frequently
2. **Faster initial load**: Only critical code loads upfront
3. **Better progressive loading**: Users load additional features as needed
4. **Reduced bundle size**: Tree-shaking and modern target (esnext)

## Recommended Next Steps
- [ ] Add service worker caching for chunks
- [ ] Implement preloading hints for likely-needed routes
- [ ] Add resource hints (prefetch/preload) for critical assets
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
